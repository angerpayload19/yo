# Security Policy

As XMT is a _security tool_, integrity and trust in the tooling (ie: _XMT itself_)
is one of the most important things to ensure for people using this software.

Monitoring bugs and potential issues is an ongoing task and we make the best effort
to ensure high quality code. However, there is always a possibility of things falling
through the cracks.

## Supported Versions

XMT is a continuously updated software solution, and as such, the best way to ensure
protection against vulnerabilities and issues it ensure that you are running the
latest version of XMT, mainly from a release version (as they are considered more
stable than the git base).

## Security Bounties and Reporting

If in the event that you find any vulnerabilities, please report any high severity
vulnerabilities via email to `xmt <at> idfla.me` and report any lower severity
vulnerabilities using the GitHub issues system with the `security` issue tag.
